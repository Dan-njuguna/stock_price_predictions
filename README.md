# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Challenge

## 🎯 Overview
This project develops ML models to predict financial asset returns using historical market data, aiming to support data-driven investment decisions.

## 🎮 Interactive Guide
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore data in `./data` folder:
4. Run example prediction: `python steps/predict.py`

## 🔍 Challenge Objective
Build predictive models that:
- ✨ Process historical market data
- 🎯 Generate future price forecasts
- 📊 Provide actionable metrics

## 📚 Data Components
Located in `./data`:
- 📈 Daily price movements
- 📊 Trading volumes
- 💹 Return calculations
- 📉 Market indicators

## 💡 Investment Guide

### 📈 Stocks vs 📊 Indices

#### Stocks
- 🎯 Single company ownership
- ⚡ Higher volatility
- 💰 Potential for larger returns
- 🔍 Requires deep research

#### Indices
- 🌐 Diversified portfolio
- 🛡️ Lower risk
- 📊 Market benchmark
- 👶 Beginner-friendly

### 🎓 Learning Path
1. **Start with Indices**
    - More stable patterns
    - Better for model training
    - Example: `data/indices/sp500_daily.csv`

2. **Graduate to Stocks**
    - Complex patterns
    - Multiple factors
    - Example: `data/stocks/individual/*.csv`

## 🛠️ Model Progression

| Level | Dataset | Models | Data Location |
|-------|---------|--------|---------------|
| 🟡 Beginner->Intermediate | Indices | ARIMA, Prophet | `data/indices/` |
| 🔴 Advanced | Stocks | Transformers, GNNs | `data/stocks/` |

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Start with index prediction using simple models, then gradually increase complexity.
